# 🧠 NERV — Networked Expressive Resource Vault

NERV is a centralized headless CMS built with Strapi, designed to power a constellation of websites, apps, services, and digital rituals. It serves as the sovereign backend for the Strong Hands, Soft Heart ecosystem — delivering structured content across domains in Markdown, HTML, and JSON via secure, flexible APIs.

This is more than just a CMS.

NERV is the central nervous system of a mythic creator's network. LOL
